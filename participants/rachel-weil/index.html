<h3>8-Bit Bandwidth: Building new networks for obsolete game consoles</h3>
<p>The history of internet-connected video game consoles, not widely known or well-understood, serves as a fascinating model for the study of ephemeral networks. In this talk, games historian and NES developer Rachel Simone Weil will give an overview of the history of networked console gaming and how obsolete technologies are being hacked and resurrected for new purposes. Weil will also walk through her latest project, an open-source wireless "modem" peripheral and twitter client for the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>
