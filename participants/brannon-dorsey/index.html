<p>Brannon Dorsey uses computational technology and reproducible electronic media to explicitly challenge digital consumption. He employs open software tools to design experiences that excite and empower individuals and collaborative communities rather than promoting the closed corporate agendas of over-powerful companies. As a young Art and Technologist, Brannon is intentional in his active participation in defining a new digital literacy that celebrates the truly profound technological era that we now live in while remaining skeptical of the ways that this technology is being used on and against us.</p>

<h3>WebRoutes</h3>
<p><i>WebRoutes</i> provides a viewer with a window into the internet infrastructure and geopolitical network topology that is inherently invisible to them as they browse the web. By visualizing an augmented traceroute process, WebRoutes identifies the Autonomous Networks (AS), ISPs, Internet Exchange Point (IXP) crossings, and Submarine Cables that work together to ping-pong TCP/IP packets back and forth from their web browsers to servers. By elongating a process that usually takes milliseconds, our installation allows the viewer to follow, analyze, and draw conclusions about the intricate, often counter-intuitive, paths their packets take on their journey through the Internet.</p>
