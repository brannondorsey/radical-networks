<h3>Protective Rituals for Post-humans</h3>
<p>A participatory art performance. We will guide participants through a chaos magic ritual to feed and strengthen the egregore of NYC Mesh and ward against malicious breach of privacy from unwanted entities.</p>

<p>In chaos magic, an egregore is an emergent phenomena similar to the genius loci, or spirit of a place. This performance will engage participants in actively co-creating such a communal entity, using a network-hosted smart phone app and the power of their intention. Participants should be ready to connect with their subconscious and/or minor godlike beings and get weird.</p>

<p>The mini-workshop session will cover the basics of chaos magic and working with collective emergent entities. We will then brainstorm our intentions for the NYC mesh network, and create a ward against malicious intrusion into the network and our devices. We will close by ritualistically casting our intent into the distributed void.</p>

<p>This workshop will be at once in the style of community-driven design practice, a situationist happening, and graphic novel made real.</p>
