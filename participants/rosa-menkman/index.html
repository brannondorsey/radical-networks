	<p>Rosa Menkman works as an artist and theorist. In her works she explores visual noise artifacts, resulting from accidents in both analogue and digital media (such as glitch, encoding and feedback artifacts). I believe these artifacts can facilitate an important insight into the otherwise obscure alchemy of standardization via resolutions, which entails not just the creation of solutions or protocols, but also black-boxed, unseen, forgotten or obfuscated compromises and alternative possibilities.</p>
