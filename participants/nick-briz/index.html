<h3>WebRoutes</h3>
<p><i>WebRoutes</i> provides a viewer with a window into the internet infrastructure and geopolitical network topology that is inherently invisible to them as they browse the web. By visualizing an augmented traceroute process, WebRoutes identifies the Autonomous Networks (AS), ISPs, Internet Exchange Point (IXP) crossings, and Submarine Cables that work together to ping-pong TCP/IP packets back and forth from their web browsers to servers. By elongating a process that usually takes milliseconds, our installation allows the viewer to follow, analyze, and draw conclusions about the intricate, often counter-intuitive, paths their packets take on their journey through the Internet.</p>
