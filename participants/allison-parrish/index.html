<h3>Reading of Texts From the Network</h3>
<p>When talking about networks, we almost exclusively talk about the interfaces we interact with, intangible but powerful forces like the cloud and algorithms, or the physical infrastructure of the network. But many intermediate layers exist in the network written as readable texts. These include HTTP headers, OUI registrants, and network SSIDs. They reveal human connections between us and our computers, the devices of others, programmers, and corporations. While hackers and other explorers of the network may see these texts, we usually register them only as information, not writing to be read or critiqued.</p>
