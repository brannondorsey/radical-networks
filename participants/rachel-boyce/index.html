<p>RB is a creative technologist and digital renaissance human with a background that spans web development to microbiology. They recently completed a Master's degree in digital media design, with a capstone project of lo-fi augmented reality for the mobile web and currently does R&amp;D as Interactive Developer at Complex Media. RB's prime directive is to create cultural tools for a post-scarcity world, that help people engage with each other and the larger social organism, through the merging of data art, co-curation, and transmedia narrative techniques. Ongoing projects include THE BOX: a series of sensual micro-environments, and Dream Cacher: an exploration of dream data.</p>

<h3>Protective Rituals for Post-humans</h3>
<p>A participatory art performance. We will guide participants through a chaos magic ritual to feed and strengthen the egregore of NYC Mesh and ward against malicious breach of privacy from unwanted entities.</p>

<p>In chaos magic, an egregore is an emergent phenomena similar to the genius loci, or spirit of a place. This performance will engage participants in actively co-creating such a communal entity, using a network-hosted smart phone app and the power of their intention. Participants should be ready to connect with their subconscious and/or minor godlike beings and get weird.</p>

<p>The mini-workshop session will cover the basics of chaos magic and working with collective emergent entities. We will then brainstorm our intentions for the NYC mesh network, and create a ward against malicious intrusion into the network and our devices. We will close by ritualistically casting our intent into the distributed void.</p>

<p>This workshop will be at once in the style of community-driven design practice, a situationist happening, and graphic novel made real.</p>
