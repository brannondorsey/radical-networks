<h3>ACV</h3>
<p>The daily use of telecommunication devices produces the illusion of direct communication between those who connect. But often we are not aware of the technical and economic infrastructure that allows this connection. The power relations in these networks are determined to a large extent by who owns the means of communication. The owner of a network can exercise its power over the users of the network through the control and monitoring of the communication system.</p>

<p>The telephone exchange intercept the calls that are made within the system, to record them and translate the recorded audio to text, to then be printed. Although its first function is to manage the calls, in the artwork, the telephone exchange becomes a control and surveillance apparatus that intercepts the communication, showing certain aspects of technology as a system of domination.</p>

<p>The audience can make calls from one phone to another by dialing the extension that corresponds to each of the six phones. All calls generated from one phone to another are managed and recorded via a Asterisk server. They are then processed to transcribe the audio content into written text to be printed. the printing is done each time a call is terminated between two telephones, the printed text shows the corresponding metadata (time, date, duration and on which phones the call was made) plus the text obtained by the speech recognition software, the printed paper falls and will accumulate during the exhibition. The telephone exchange has access to the internet, since the voice recognition software is a service provided by Google.</p>
