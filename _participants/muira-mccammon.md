<h3>GiTMO, FOIA, NARA, and 500 Deleted Tweets: Lessons from a War Crimes Researcher</h3>
<p>This talk will focus on the problems underlying the Federal Records Act and the freedom it has given various federal agencies to develop their own fragmented approaches towards the archiving of tweets. It incorporates over 15 different Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests as well as a case study from my own research involving over 500 deleted tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/jtfgtmo" target="_blank">@jtfgtmo</a> (the Twitter feed run by the branch of the U.S. government responsible for managing the detention facilities in GiTMO).</p>
