<p>Imagine another Internet. Location specific, not through geofencing, but through the physical limits of its infrastructure. There are webpages here that do not exist there. Like a street mural, this Internet island becomes a projection and a reflection of the network neighborhood.</p>

<p>The Internet is a large communication network comprised of smaller networks. Its power is obvious ‚Äì communication over great distances of wire has enabled virtual communities to come together, organize, share, and create. However, in our excitement about wide area communications we have neglected the local area, the physical communities in which our infrastructure lives. While the Internet continues to develop into a tool for institutional control and corporate surveillance, I believe that the local area network can function as a site for resistance and coalition building. The Othernet is not The Internet, but rather AN Internet. A new network territory with its own laws. No Internet Service Providers. No quiet collection from advertising networks. No Facebook. No Google.</p>
