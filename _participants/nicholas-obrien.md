<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Emergent Marketplaces in Online Video Games</h3>
<p>Based on historical research I’ve done on 90-00s instances of video game currencies acquiring IRL value, this talk wishes to discuss emergent, user-centric, virtual marketplaces and offline networks of black/gray market video game ephemera. This material includes presenting networks involved in gold duping, Ebay auctioning of virtual property, the Steam Marketplace (and the clashing communities of hobbyist and for-profit game modders), as well as counterfeit Amiibo crafters. Though some of these networks are monitored and regulated—the Steam Marketplace is a good example—others are often ad hoc.</p>

<p>For <em>Radical Networks</em> I want to discuss networks that operate either outside or on the fringes of game studio regulation. Furthermore I want to investigate how these networks form, grow, and find ways of becoming incorporated into sanctioned economic communities. Often the work of ardent fans that initiate improvisational networks create legitimate money making strategies for blockbuster studios and triple-A developers. For this talk I want to argue that these networks and communities should be left alone to creatively self-organize virtual marketplaces in order to foster emergent forms of play.</p>
