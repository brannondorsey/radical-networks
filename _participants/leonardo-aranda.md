<h2>Workshop</h2>
<h3>SMSbot</h3>
<p>This is a theory-practice workshop which aim is to investigate into the possibilities of using SMS's as a mean for alternative communication in an era in which this techology has fallen in disuse. The workshop will consist, first, in a discussion around the possibilities of appropiating of SMS technology for creative and political uses, and then it will try to develope an alternative mean of communication following the conclusions of the first part. Some technical knowledge will be shared around building of a custom SMS bot through the use Adafruit's FONA board, Arduino and a Raspberry PI.</p>

<h2>Exhibiting</h2>
<h3>PirateCycle</h3>
<p>Network of Creative Pollution is a device that hacks the main function of bicycles, to turn them into an alternative means of dissemination and propagation of contents. The device operates in a parasitic manner both of the vehicles to which it is attached, and of the telecommunication networks that it uses to fulfill its function. Through the recovery of disused technologies such as SMS messages, the project investigates three areas of exploration: alternative mobility, networking and citizen participation and radiofrequency governance, using art as a way of problematizing our relationship with each of these areas. The device creates a network of content propagation, but unlike extremely structured communication networks, this network is constructed through uncertainty and chance in a logic more similar to how pollen travels between flowers using insects as a medium of transport. The project builds an Exquisite corpse by remixing and redistributing SMS messages received in a semi-random manner, creating a common incoherent narrative by this process. This project was initiated at Interactivos17 at the Medialab-Prado, Madrid.</p>
