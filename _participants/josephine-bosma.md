<h3>The World in 24 Hours</h3>
<p>Together with artist Patrick Lichty, Josephine will present research about an early network art project from 1982 called The World in 24 Hours (W24H), which was organized and initiated at the time by the late artist Robert Adrian, and ask the audience to think about a possible restaging. W24H was a one-day online performance connecting 12 cities across the globe via the email/electronic message system of the company I.P.Sharp and more. It was one of the first artist projects involving a global computer network and the artists had high hopes for the medium. We want to investigate if it is possible to interpret this work from a conservation perspective and what would be needed to do so. If it can't be done we want to formulate precisely why this is so. We wonder what would be needed to restage this work in a post-Snowden context.</p>
