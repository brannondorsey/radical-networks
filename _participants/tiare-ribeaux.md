<p>Tiare Ribeaux is an Hawaiian-American new media artist and curator. Her work seeks to provoke conversation around opaque global industrial systems that are omnipresent yet often invisible in our day-to-day lives. She has a background in fashion design and biotechnology and is interested in shanzhai, deep/dark/media ecology, rhizomatic networks, speculative futures, and collaborative entanglements. She has been a Bay Area based curator and producer of visual and performing arts focused on innovation and radical inclusivity for over 5 years. She recently produced the Soundwave ((7)) Biennial in San Francisco in 2016, and has curated productions with Gray Area, the de Young Museum, the California Academy of Sciences, Fort Mason Center for the Arts, the Oakland Museum of California and and is the Founder and Artistic Director at B4BEL4B Gallery in Oakland, CA.</p>

<h3>Onion Routing AR Walking TOR</h3>
<p><em>Onion Routing AR Walking TOR</em> is a participatory interpretation of the inner workings of onion routing and the TOR browser using augmented reality and location-based virtual markers. Each participant will visit a group of geolocated 3D models as waypoints around the Radical Networks venue forming a simulation of onion routing where the user represents a programmatically routed data packet. Each route is randomly generated with each stop slowly decrypting a hidden message.
