<h3>Global Action Project Film Screening and Panel Discussion</h3>
<p>Come to this film screening and panel discussion of The C.O.R.E., the latest production of SupaFriends, Global Action Project's TLGBQ youth media making program. The film takes place in the year 2032. The dictator Solomon has seized power over one of the five islands remaining after a major world war and stripped people of human rights and freedom. Art and gender expression are outlawed. Borders are highly regulated, and no one is safe. Despite the danger, a group of trans and gender nonconforming People of Color organizers come together to resist.</p>
