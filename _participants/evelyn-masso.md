<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Designing Network User Interfaces</h3>
<p>How do we design for the agency of network hardware’s end users? Home router configuration is difficult without extensive technical understanding (and designing that experience is equally hard). I’ll discuss concepts and design patterns for guiding non-technical users through the setup their own home router. We’ll focus on a standard consumer wi-fi router setup experience and draw on competitive analysis of the major consumer router brands to compare different design patterns. I’ll also talk about my experience applying these ideas while working as a user experience designer at a major consumer networking company.</p>
