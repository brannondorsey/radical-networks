<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Buena Vista Social Network</h3>
<p>Cuba has many faces. But one of its lesser known is how Cubans access this worldwide network of networks called The Internet. We do know Cubans have to go through hoops in order to do things that we take for granted elsewhere and thus have mastered the art of achieving great things with a limited access to resources. This presentation is an ongoing research, a picture of the wonders that shape the networking landscape of this island and a wake-on-LAN message to connect with the rest of us.</p>
