<h3>Onion Routing AR Walking TOR</h3>
<p><em>Onion Routing AR Walking TOR</em> is a participatory interpretation of the inner workings of onion routing and the TOR browser using augmented reality and location-based virtual markers. Each participant will visit a group of geolocated 3D models as waypoints around the Radical Networks venue forming a simulation of onion routing where the user represents a programmatically routed data packet. Each route is randomly generated with each stop slowly decrypting a hidden message.
