<p>From mass surveillance to the over-commercialization of the 
Internet, the technology that we depend upon for community  and 
connection is being compromised. The recent accessibility of 
networking technology through devices such as the Raspberry Pi 
and software such as BATMAN Adv has made it affordable and possible 
for everyday citizens to learn how to design their own web servers 
and networks.</p>
