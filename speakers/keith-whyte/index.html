<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>On being the alternative in the absence of alternatives</h3>
<p>This talk will begin with a short description of the Rhizomatica Community Cellular Network installations, a run down on the technology used, and a brief update on recent changes and advances for those who have been following the project.
We'll take a look at some of the problems encountered; remote networks in difficult to access places, users expectations - providing 'carrier grade' service on self owned networks while those networks still depend on connections to upstream non free (internet) networks.</p>

<p>This will be followed by a thought and hopefully discussion provoking look at introducing new technology into a community.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of radio, a marvellous tool for empowerment, mass media through radio, television and cinema has been consistently used as a means for cultural imposition and control. For many today, it may seem strange and far off to imagine a world without even a simple landline, yet like so much technology, even the simple landline changes aspects of community life. Todays corporate internet, (essentially an extension of telephony) would appear to be going the same direction, as new users are sought out based on how their potential activity on the network can be monetized.
From the perspective of bringing an alternative network to where there is still space to dream how that network might be, What can be done about these issues, or is it already too late? Are there ethical questions to be asked about connecting the whole world to a corporate network, and if there are, then who asks them and more importantly, who gives the answers?</p>
