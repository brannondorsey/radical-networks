<p>Originally from France, I trained in both software engineering and design before moving to Canada 9 years ago. My interests span activism, politics, museography, information design, open data and technology. I have been publishing and contributing to open-source since 1999, and I believe above all else in in participation, free sharing of information, and the power of communities. I co-founded the local open data movement in Montréal and information design studio, FFunction, which is now in its seventh year. More recently, I started exploring how offline networks can change our understanding of information sharing, and how it can be applied to locative art and new media. I live and work in Montréal.</p>
