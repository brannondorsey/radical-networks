<p>My name is Andre Castro. I am a media designer, with a background in sound art and experimental music, and a current practice focused on hybrid publishing, underground digital libraries ( Bibliotecha ) and the intersection between technology and design processes. I am a user and advocate of Free/Open Source software.</p>

<p>I work as a tutor at the Master of Media Design and Communication at the Piet Zwart Institute and at Willem de Kooning's Publication Station. In 2013 I completed the Master's program of Media Design and Communication at the Piet Zwart Institute, and graduated in 2007 from the Sonic Arts BA program at Middlesex University.</p>
