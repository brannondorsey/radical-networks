<p>My name is Andre Castro. I am a media designer, with a background in sound art and experimental music, and a current practice focused on hybrid publishing, underground digital libraries ( Bibliotecha ) and the intersection between technology and design processes. I am a user and advocate of Free/Open Source software.</p>

<p>I work as a tutor at the Master of Media Design and Communication at the Piet Zwart Institute and at Willem de Kooning's Publication Station. In 2013 I completed the Master's program of Media Design and Communication at the Piet Zwart Institute, and graduated in 2007 from the Sonic Arts BA program at Middlesex University.</p>

<h3>Workshop: Bibliotecha</h3>

<p>Bibliotecha is a local offline network for distribution of digital texts, which allows small communities to build and share their electronic text collections.
Bibliotecha relies on a small computer (a RaspberryPi) running open-source software to serve the ebooks over a local WIFI hotspot. Using the browser to connect to it, one is given the option to retrieve or donate texts.</p>

<p>Bibliotecha's workshop is centered on implementing from the ground up a series of Bibliotecha nodes.
The workshop will introduce Bibliotecha's essential architecture, the open-source software it relies upon, such as Calibre, Lighttpd and hostapd, as well as Unix/Linux fundamental concepts such as the shell interface, time-sharing, SSH protocol, Linux software repositories, captive portals, etc. 
At the end of the workshop each (group of) participant(s) will take home a Bibliotecha node, ready to distribute electronic books.</p>

<p>Participants with all levels of knowledge are welcomed. You just need to have a laptop and be at ease with it ;]</p>
