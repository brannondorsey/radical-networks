<h3>Bringing connectivity to rural areas in Bangladesh</h3>
<p>Women in Bangladesh in 90s were disadvantaged particularly in science and technology fields. Their scientific knowledge and talents were poorly recognized in the community and their work places. The scientific activities were considered males jobs. An initiative was taken in 1996 to empower the Woman Scientists, Technologists and Researchers of Bangladesh with Information Technology using computers under the banner of the Association for Advancement of Information Technology (AAIT). Senior scientists, technologists and researchers were contacted for training on new technology (IT) which was unknown to most of the participants with the back ground of PhD. They were trained through several workshops organizing in universities at different cities. The Commonwealth Science Council (CSC) joined the IT program with technology and finance. Lots of barriers we had to face in organizing the workshops. There were social, local, gender and other problems. Different strategies were adopted to make the programs a success which I would like to share in the event. The program concept were spreading day by day by the women scientists who were trained by the AAIT experts. An excellent network of women scientists, technologists, researchers, science girl-students of all levels including the remote girls of Bangladesh and abroad have been developed through this initiative.</p>
