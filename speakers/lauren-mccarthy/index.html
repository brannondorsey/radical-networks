<h3>Follower</h3>
<p>Follower is a mobile app based performance art piece. Follower acts as service that provides a real life follower for day. In order to be followed, you answer two questions: Why do you want to be followed? Why should someone follow you?</p>

<p>If selected, you’re given an app to install. The following lasts one day; you don't know when it will happen. At the end, you’re left with one photo of you, taken by your Follower. The Follower stays just out of sight, but within your consciousness.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between attention and surveillance? There are sites you can go to to buy online followers, $10 can get you 1000 followers. We have this intense desire to be seen, to feel connected. How does this fit with our fear of surveillance? We imagine "the man" or Google or the government watching us, but does it feel different if we know it's a real live human?</p>
