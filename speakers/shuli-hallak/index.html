<h3>Seeing the Internet</h3>
<p>The power of the Internet is derived from its intangible, invisible properties. The ability of information to scale and traverse in an instant is transformative, and the application of that power can be used in multiple ways, some good and some not so good. Because we can not see these systems that we rely on — the hardware (routers, switches, data centers, fiber cables), and invisible properties (spectrum, wireless networks, protocol) — we are as a whole, left in the dark and unaware of how our own data exists in these networks. We often take a breath and hope the entities that we are “agreeing” with (“trusting”) will do good.  And we are presented with less than desirable options: convenience or privacy, but we can’t have both. Really though, if we can’t see it, we can’t fully trust it.</p>

<p>But what if we could see how the Internet works? What if we could see both the physical and intangible?I’ll show and discuss the physical infrastructure of the Internet, which I’ve been photographing for several years — parts that are normally completely off limits to the public — and explain with visuals how some of the intangible properties work.</p>

<p>If we can see the Internet as a whole, we can build visual concepts and language around it, and we can understand where to place our trust. We can understand where and how common infrastructure breaches happen, such as Prism. We can begin to understand how our data is used as a commodity. And we can understand that sometimes, trusting ourselves is worth more than convenience.</p>
