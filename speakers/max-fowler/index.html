<p>I am a programmer, artist and vaporware enthusiast currently based in New York. Some of my recent projects have explored the ways that we conceptualize space, expressive analysis of text message history and how to use a twitter bot to take out the trash. I'm interested in using data visualization to explore subjectivity, generative poetry, and the ways we use technology to decide what to read. I recently participated in SFPC's 10 week summer session (<a href="http://sfpc.io" target="_blank">sfpc.io</a>) this past summer and am currently living in New York and working as a freelance developer.</p>

<h3>Oasis</h3>
<p>Oasis is a virtual gallery for terminal and textual works contained within a raspberry pi only accessible by SSH. The pi uses the file tree as a spatial metaphor to create a virtual world where users can communicate (through ytalk), leave files, and explore. My intention is to explore the possibilities of an autonomous network created with the minimal possible components (contrasting with traditional websites and forms of networked interaction). Visit <a href="http://oasisvr.info" target="_blank">http://oasisvr.info</a> for instructions on how to SSH into this autonomous network. </p>
