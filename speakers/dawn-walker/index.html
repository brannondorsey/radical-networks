<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Workshop: Ways of Seeing: Visualizing Networks</h3>
<p>Immaterial networks can be hard to make sense of, analyze or critique without tangible artefacts to engage with. I will explore this challenge through a hands on workshop where participants will use a full range of senses and modalities to visualize and map networks. Through individual and group exercises we will experiment with different techniques designed to reveal connections and flows within networks.</p>

<p>No experience necessary!</p>
