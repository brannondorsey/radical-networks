<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Socializing Public Spaces With Shared Input From Mobile Devices</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.livelyevent.com" target="_blank">Project Page</a></p>
<p>This talk will discuss recent projects I am working on that focus on allowing large-scale collaborative input from people in shared spaces using data from the mobile devices such as cellphones and tablets. Beginning with an earlier project of mine called “SimpleTEXT” that encouraged mass contributions from people sending text messages from mobiles phones to drive a public performance, I will expand on this project by introducing a new product I have launched called “<a href="http://www.livelyevent.com" target="_blank">Lively</a>” that takes advantage of the ubiquity of mobile devices using browser-based output and WebGL visualizations of incoming text messages by large audiences. The project has been performed at a wide range of public spaces such as large conferences, public movie theaters and performance spaces, and co-working spaces.</p>
