<img src="Adam-Rothstein-256x256.jpg" />
<p>Adam Rothstein is an insurgent archivist and artist. He writes about politics, media, art, and technology wherever he can get a signal. He is most interested in the canons of history and prediction, the so-called "Future-Weird", the unstable ramifications of today's cultural technology, and the materials and ideas out of which we build things. His book Drone was published by Bloomsbury Publishing in 2015. He is on Twitter @interdome.</p>
