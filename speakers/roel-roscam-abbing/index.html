<h2>Presenting with <a href="../dennis-de-bel/">Dennis de Bel</a></h2>
<h3>Workshop: Packet Radio Networks</h3>
<p>Before there was the internet there was a wireless internet. In this (non-FCC approved) workshop we will look back to ALOHANET, AMPRNET and examine the phenomenon of packet radio. The workshop will be a hands-on, interactive demonstration of the possibilities of packet radio and the workflow/toolchain. We will go into both historical and contemporary examples and try to set up a little network on the spot.</p>

<p>Participants will learn how to utilize commercial walkie-talkie radios and free software to transmit and receive TCP/IP over HF or UHF radio. In other words, internet via walkie-talkie, because yes, that's possible. Looking beyond the usual "When Shit Hits The Fan Scenario's" we will discuss the true potential and shortcomings of these 6km+ range wireless 'routers'. Depending on the wishes of the participants we can either do a demo and go through the steps and requirements of setting this up for themselves or help set up participant's own equipment to create one big offline network.</p>

<p>Participants will get a small publication that is both an introduction into the concept as well as a practical guide on how set up your internet over walkie talkie. Each participant will get one copy as a reference etc for when they want to do their own experiments.</p>

<p>No experience is necessary.</p>
