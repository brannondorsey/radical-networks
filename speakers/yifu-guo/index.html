<p>This is what the internet infrastructure looks like today, and for most of us, our interactions with the stack never falls below the Application layer.</p>

<p>I want to bring light to the questions like,<br/>
What is chrome doing when you are visiting a website?<br/>
What is skype doing on your computer when you make a call?</p>

<p>Show off some new equipment in network DIY, e.g. self contained battery powered openWRT routers.</p>

<p>The goal is to educate and show people how to be their own gate keepers of their network, by man-in-the-middle attacking themselves to see their own network traffic and grant control of what type of data you should and should not allow.</p>
