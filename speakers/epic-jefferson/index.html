<p>I've been working with technology for about 6 years now. I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Tangible Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on sound design and interfaces for the performance of sound.</p>

<p>Since 2013, I've co-directed the <a href="http://ledhack.org/" target="_blank">Lab for Erroneous Design</a>, Puerto Rico's first hackerspace.</p>

<h3>Crowsourced (or not) Public Transportation GPS Tracking</h3>
<p>I grew up in Puerto Rico, which has currently been in the public eye in America due to it's social/economic shenanigans. Many of it’s public services (namely the Public Transportation System) are crippled, unable to provide adequate service to the population. Some routes have only 1 bus pass every hour or hour and a half, only to have the bus pass you by because it’s filled to the brim.</p>

<p>Even though these buses have actually had a GPS system installed since around 2006, it has only been used by a private company to “prevent theft”.</p>

<p>I’m proposing a system where riders provide the GPS data themselves, for each other. Using a simple phone application (currently Android only), riders can transmit their own GPS data, making the bus location known to other potential riders in real-time, through the corresponding site that loads the data on a map.</p>

<p>Ideally, the Public Transportation System itself could implement this system, as it very cheap to implement and keep running.</p>
