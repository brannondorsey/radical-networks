<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Workshop: Commotion Wireless</h3>
<p>Commotion is a project that helps communities use cheap wireless
hardware and open-source software to build their own network
infrastructure. These networks can help spread cheap internet access, as
well as provide a powerful alternative to traditional networks through
providing local services, local ownership, and resilience. At this
workshop, one of Commotion's developers will walk participants through
the process of organizing, designing, and building their own networks.
Additionally, we will talk about the technology behind community
networks, and the rich history of such networks throughout the world.</p>
