<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Workshop: Raising a Commotion: How to build a Community Wireless Network</h3>
<p>For over 15 years, creative individuals have been banding
together in different places around the world to use whatever
technology they have available to build community wireless networks.
These networks are organized in many different ways, use many different
kinds of technology, and provide many kinds of services to their
communities.</p>

<p><a href="https://commotionwireless.net/" target="_blank">Commotion Wireless</a> is a project to make it easier for non-technical
users to build their own networks. In the first part of this workshop,
you'll learn about  the history of community wireless networks around
the world, and then apply the Commotion toolkit in an activity to
design a network for your neighborhood.</p>

<p>In the second part of the workshop, you'll have a hands-on opportunity
to use the Commotion software to build a wireless mesh network using
off-the-shelf devices. Participants will come away with an new
understanding and new ideas for how to build a network for their
neighborhood.</p>
