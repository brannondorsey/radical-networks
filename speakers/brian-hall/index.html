<h3>NYC Mesh, a community owned Wi-Fi network</h3>
<p>NYC Mesh is a community-owned resilient Wi-Fi mesh network, started by a group of passionate volunteers in New York City.</p>

<p>The aim is to create a free, resilient, stand-alone communication system that serves both for daily use and also for emergencies — be it power outages or Internet disruption — running software that helps our community with hyperlocal maps and events.</p>

<p>During this talk, Brian, Dan and Julien will present the status of the network, how it works, how to get involved and why this could be useful for artists, technologists and the people of New York. There will also be some prepared nodes that you can buy ($28) and bring home to get yourself immediately on board.</p>
