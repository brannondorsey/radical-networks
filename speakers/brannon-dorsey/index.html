<h3>Brannon Dorsey</h3>
<!--img src="me_pic3.png" width="50%" /-->
<p>Brannon Dorsey uses computational technology and reproducible electronic media to explicitly challenge digital consumption. He employs open software tools to design experiences that excite and empower individuals and collaborative communities rather than promoting the closed corporate agendas of over-powerful companies. As a young Art and Technologist, Brannon is intentional in his active participation in defining a new digital literacy that celebrates the truly profound technological era that we now live in while remaining skeptical of the ways that this technology is being used on and against us.</p>

<h3>Probe Kit</h3>
<p>Probe Kit is a satirical “amateur data collection” kit, which makes the process of collecting and contextualizing the wireless network data of the people around you trivially easy. Probe Kit is critical software art developed to illustrate how simple it is to collect personal network data and how much can be inferred from that data. Sarcastically pitched as an “amateur data collector kit”, Probe Kit turns your wifi card into a “net” that catches data fluttering out of the wireless devices of the people around you.</p>
