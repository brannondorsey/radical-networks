<h3>Dennis de Bel</h3>
<img src="bio2.jpg" />
<p>Dennis de Bel (1984, NL) graduated in June 2007 as an Interactive Media designer at the Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam. In June 2009, he completed the Master Media Design and Communication at the Piet Zwart Institute, also in Rotterdam.</p>

<p>De Bel's exploration of interactivity and utility has led him to make humorous design interventions, manifested word puns, useless software and more recently "no-ware". This term describes some of his latest works that are no longer hardware nor software but non-products, unique multiples and mass-produced one-offs that question functionality, inventiveness and innovation.</p>

<p>Currently he is collaborating with <a href="../roel-roscam-abbing">Roel Roscam Abbing</a> on a practical research project on 'Post-Digital Communication in the last days of the web'.</p>
