<h3>Rachel O'Dwyer</h3>
<p>I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Centre for Telecommunications Research and lecturer in Trinity College Dublin, where I teach courses in physical computing and media theory. My research areas include the Political Economy of Communications; Open Spectrum; Blockchains and P2P Infrastructures for Money.</p> 

<p>I'm the leader of the Dublin Art and Technology Association, a group that showcases individuals working across art, hacktivism and technology <a href="http://www.data.ie" target="_blank">www.data.ie</a>. I organise the openhere festival on the social, political and technical issues surrounding the digital commons. 2012 focused on disruptive telecommunications; 2014 on open source hardware, open source ecology and open source value <a href="http://www.openhere.data.ie" target="_blank">www.openhere.data.ie</a>. I am also a core member of the P2P Foundation where I contribute to research in alternative currencies and coordinate the P2P academic research network.</p>

<p>I speak, write and organise workshops around topics such as the political economy of communications, the digital commons, disruptive telecommunications, open spectrum and more recently money, distributed infrastructures and the blockchain. Hereâ€™s a project I coordinated to make a fully open mobile network in Dublin City <a href="http://openhere.data.ie/?p=500" target="_blank">http://openhere.data.ie/?p=500</a>. As well as academic publications, I am a regular contributor to Neural a magazine of media art, hacktivism and critical internet cultures <a href="http://neural.it" target="_blank">http://neural.it</a> and the Commons Transition blog <a href="http://commonstransition.org/the-revolution-will-not-be-decentralised-blockchains/" target="_blank">http://commonstransition.org/the-revolution-will-not-be-decentralised-blockchains/</a> Some of my recent talks and publications are here <a href="https://tcd.academia.edu/RachelODwyer" target="_blank">https://tcd.academia.edu/RachelODwyer</a>.</p>
