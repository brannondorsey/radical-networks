<p>Bibliotecha is a local offline network for distribution of digital texts, which allows small communities to build and share their electronic text collections.
Bibliotecha relies on a small computer (a RaspberryPi) running open-source software to serve the ebooks over a local WIFI hotspot. Using the browser to connect to it, one is given the option to retrieve or donate texts.</p>

<p>Bibliotecha's workshop is centered on implementing from the ground up a series of Bibliotecha nodes.
The workshop will introduce Bibliotecha's essential architecture, the open-source software it relies upon, such as Calibre, Lighttpd and hostapd, as well as Unix/Linux fundamental concepts such as the shell interface, time-sharing, SSH protocol, Linux software repositories, captive portals, etc. 
At the end of the workshop each (group of) participant(s) will take home a Bibliotecha node, ready to distribute electronic books.</p>

<p>Participants with all levels of knowledge are welcomed. You just need to have a laptop and be at ease with it ;]</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>Please bring:
<ul>
	<li>Raspberry Pi (model 1) or Raspberry Pi 2 (model 2)</li>
	<li>SD-card (for Pi model 1) or Micro-SD card (for Pi model 2), class: 10, minimum size: 6GB.</li>
	<li>Power-supply for Raspberry Pi</li>
	<li>Ethernet cable</li>
