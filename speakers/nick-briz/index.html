<h3>Probe Kit</h3>
<p>Probe Kit is a satirical “amateur data collection” kit, which makes the process of collecting and contextualizing the wireless network data of the people around you trivially easy. Probe Kit is critical software art developed to illustrate how simple it is to collect personal network data and how much can be inferred from that data. Sarcastically pitched as an “amateur data collector kit”, Probe Kit turns your wifi card into a “net” that catches data fluttering out of the wireless devices of the people around you.</p>
