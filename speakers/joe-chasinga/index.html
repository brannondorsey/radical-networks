<p>I'm an interaction designer self-taught in computer programming. I have always been an artist until after college when I found peace in technology and communication. I came from Thailand, a country undergoing political changes and struggling to understand her own ground. My interests are computer network, internet of things, physical computing and writing. I'm also actively developing an open source library for arduino in Python for educational purpose.</p>
