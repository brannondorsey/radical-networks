<h2>Presenting</h2>
<h3>Decentralized Peer To Peer Social Networks</h3>
<p>I'd like to present a decentralized peer to peer social network I have been working on. I'll first talk about the two underlying open source projects: cjdns and ipfs. Specifically the flaws in the current internet these projects seek to address and their proposed solutions. Then I will give a live demo of my project to show what is possible with these next generation protocols. If time permits I can talk about NYC Mesh and our group effort to build a wireless mesh network in the city.</p>
