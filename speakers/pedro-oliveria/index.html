<h3>Appropriating Technologies for Protests of the Future</h3>
<p>The number of technologies used by authorities during protests are growing year after year.</p>

<p>Mass surveillance has become ubiquitous, personal devices are being used as weapons against their owners, the hyper-militarization of law enforcement is widespread and the use of long range acoustic devices, active denial systems and stingrays have become commonplace as governments attempt to suppress dissent and monitor their citizens.</p>

<p>How can the global community retain the right to free speech and public assembly in a safe and effective manner? How can we level the technological playing field for activists and the general population?</p>

<p>Backslash is a series of functional devices designed for protests and riots of the future. Created through the lens of critical design, Backslash aims to retain the right to connect in protest sites through disruptive innovation and the creative appropriation of existing technologies. The range of devices include a smart bandana for embedding hidden messages and public keys, independently networked wearable devices, personal blackbox devices to register abuse of law enforcement and fast deployment routers for off grid communication.</p>

<p>Political, social and technological conditions vary immensely from country to country. Not every protest is like Hong Kong where the average protester has 3 personal devices connected to the internet. A one size fits all solution to these dynamic situations is impractical. This really highlights the significance of community driven design and the importance of inciting this discourse with the global tech community. We recognize that creative and transdisciplinary approach at local hackerspaces and fab labs are uniquely capable of engineering innovative solutions that best fit the needs of their immediate community.</p>

<p>â€“In protests of the future, how will the underground fight back?</p>
