<h3>Call For Proposals!</h3>

<p>From mass surveillance to the over-commercialization of the Internet, the concept of a free and open Internet is being threatened by corporate interests and over-reaching governments. Radical Networks is an environment for critical discussion around these issues and a place to learn more about policy, DIY networking and how computer networks work.</p>

<p>We invite artists, lawyers, engineers, writers, policy makers, educators, scientists, journalists, community organizers, and more to present your ideas in this yearâ€™s Radical Networks. Submit a proposal for a workshop, a talk, a performance or to participate in our exhibition. Some possible topics include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Offline networks</li>
	<li>Mesh networks</li>
	<li>Local networks for community</li>
	<li>Experimental application of computer networks</li>
	<li>Networks for political activism</li>
	<li>Network security for ordinary citizens</li>
	<li>Artistic use of computer networks</li>
