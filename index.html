          <p>From mass surveillance to the the over-commercialization of the 
Internet, the technology that we depend upon for community  and 
connection is being compromised. The recent accessibility of 
networking technology through devices such as the Raspberry Pi 
and software such as BATMAN Adv has made it affordable and possible 
for everyday citizens to learn how to design their own web servers 
and networks. </p>

<p>Join us for two days of speakers, panels and workshops designed to 
introduce the community to DIY networking. Learn how to create your 
own offline networks, portable web servers, mesh networks or internet 
gateways in hands on workshops. Attend panels where you can discuss 
your visions for how a localized network could support your school, 
your community, or your cause. Listen to speakers talk about the future 
of computer networks and why it’s important to understand how networks 
work in this age of hyper-connectivity. </p>

<p><em>QUESTIONS</em>
What would you do with your own network?
Why does it matter to understand how networks work?
Why do community networks matter?
How could free, open local networks benefit people?
What can networks be used for other than social networking and commerical use?</p>

<p><em>THEMES</em>
Community
Education
Activism
Art</p>

<p><em>GOALS</em>
To understand how the technology can be used as a method of control 
and how to subvert that.

<p><em>IDEALS</em>
Promoting free and open networks built with free and open hardware and software
Decentralizing the control of where networks exist and what and whom are served by them
Maintaining control of our own content, hardware, and means of deployment
Community and education first</p>
