<p>Join us for two days of speakers, panels and workshops designed to 
introduce the community to DIY networking. Learn how to create your 
own offline networks, portable web servers, mesh networks or internet 
gateways in hands on workshops. Attend panels where you can discuss 
your visions for how a localized network could support your school, 
your community, or your cause. Listen to speakers talk about the future 
of computer networks and why itâ€™s important to understand how networks 
work in this age of hyper-connectivity.</p>
