## Description of your talk / panel / workshop / demo

I automate repetitive storytelling, enhance my memory, and generally 
augment my social interactions through a network of
[bespoke](https://thomaslevine.com/!/computers/)
[computer](https://thomaslevine.com/!/whom-to-email/)
[software](https://github.com/tlevine/dadaportal)
designed specifically for me.
I will discuss the various tools that I use and how they
[transform](https://thomaslevine.com/!/hypermediated-conversation/)
my communications, and I will conclude with some

[steps](https://thomaslevine.com/!/tom-computer-school/#firstday)
that you can take if you would like to create a similar digital appendage for yourself.

## Speaker Bio

Thomas Levine is a dada artist who really likes to sleep.
His interest in sleep is largely a rebellion against his upbringing in America
that involved many elements of the
[Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic).
When he isn't sleeping, he often develops experimental lifestyles and
life-automation software in an effort to give himself more time to sleep.
