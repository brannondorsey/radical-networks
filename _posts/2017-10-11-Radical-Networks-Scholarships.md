<h3>Announcing Radical Networks Scholarships</h3>

<p>We understand that it can be difficult to attend conferences and festivals for a variety of reasons. Therefore, we are happy to provide support for 45 scholarships to Radical Networks.</p>

<p>Our ability to offer these scholarships is wholly due to the generous donations from our Kickstarter supporters. Huge thanks to all of you who made this possible!</p>

<h3>What We Offer</h3>
<p>Full conference passes are available, which will provide access to all of the talks on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (Oct 20-22).

<h3>Who Should Apply</h3>
<p>Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for this scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.</p>

<h3>How To Apply</h3>
<p>Applying is simple - just <a href="mailto:info@radicalnetworks.org">email us</a> and tell us about why you would like to come to Radical Networks this year.</p>
