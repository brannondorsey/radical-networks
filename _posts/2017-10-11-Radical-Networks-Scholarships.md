<h3>Announcing Radical Networks Scholarships</h3>

<p>We firmly support diversity and inclusion at Radical Networks, and understand that for a variety of reasons, it can in general be difficult to attend conferences and festivals. In order to promote diversity and help offset financial burdens, we are happy to offer 45 scholarships for Radical Networks.</p>

<h3>What We Offer</h3>
<p>Full conference passes are available, which will provide access to all of the talks on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (Oct 20-22).

<p>Our ability to offer these scholarships is wholly due to the generous donations from our Kickstarter supporters. Huge thanks to all of you who made this possible!</p>

<h3>Who Should Apply</h3>
<p>Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for this scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.</p>
