title: Announcing: Radical Networks 2017 Kickstarter Campaign!
---
<p>We are excited to announce the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radicalnetworks/radical-networks" target="_blank">Radical Networks 2017 Kickstarter</a> Campaign!</p>

<p>Because we want to remain independent of corporate sponsorship and keep the cost of attendance low, we've decided to run this campaign in order to help pay for production costs and logistics, higher fees and travel support for our participants, and to provide scholarships for people who would like to attend but need a little bit of help.</p>

<p>Please support our effots by getting the word out and backing our campaign! Presale passes to Radical Networks are only available through <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radicalnetworks/radical-networks" target="_blank">our Kickstarter</a>, so head over there to secure your tickets today!</p>
