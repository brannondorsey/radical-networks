	Sarah is a Brooklyn-based artist and educator. She is a former artist-in-residence of the Eyebeam Art and Technology Center and is currently a Technical Lead at The Barbarian Group and Adjunct Professor at NYU Polytechnic in Digital Media. Her work explores both the practical and expressive properties of wireless networks for connecting people who are in close proximity to each other in order to encourage participation within their immediate geographical location. To support this, she developed the Subnodes project (http://subnod.es), which attempts to make DIY networking more understandable and accessible to non-technical people, in addition to creating a set of tools for her own experiments.
